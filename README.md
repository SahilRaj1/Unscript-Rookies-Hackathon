## Financial Management System
We apply multiple supervised machine learning techniques to the problem of fraud detection using a publicly available simulated payment transactions data. We aim
to demonstrate how supervised ML techniques can be used to classify data with high class imbalance with high accuracy.
We demonstrate that exploratory analysis can be used to separate fraudulent and nonfraudulent transactions. We also demonstrate that for a well separated dataset, treebased algorithms like Random Forest work much better than Logistic Regression.
