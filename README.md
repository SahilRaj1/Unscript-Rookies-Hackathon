## Financial Management System
We apply multiple supervised machine learning techniques to the problem of fraud detection using a publicly available simulated payment transactions data. We aim
to demonstrate how supervised ML techniques can be used to classify data with high class imbalance with high accuracy.
We demonstrate that exploratory analysis can be used to separate fraudulent and nonfraudulent transactions. 

* Through exploratory analysis, we analyzed the data set in detail and identified
possible predictors of fraud.
* Through various visualization techniques, we observed the separation between
fraud and non-fraud transactions.
* To solve the fraud detection problem, we experimented with two supervised
machine learning techniques â€“ Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
* Additionally, we also tried under-sampling to address the class imbalance in the
dataset.
* The models were developed with cross-validation to avoid overfitting and obtain
consist of performance.
* Performance measures, like Confusion Matrix and Area Under Curve (AUC), was
used to compare the performance of the models.

### This analysis was conducted using Python through Jupyter notebook. In-built libraries and methods were used to run the machine learning models.
